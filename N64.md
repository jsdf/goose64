# Notes on coding for the N64

## C Language limitations
The exeGCC compiler that comes with the n64 sdk only supports roughly the C89 standard of features, which means all variables have to be declared at the top of a function (no inline declaration in for-loops, for example)

## Data Structures shared between main CPU and RCP via DMA
To tell the graphics microcode where to render objects we need to allocate Mtx (matrix) structures containing the transform (position + rotation) information which will be used by the graphics microcode. The C code you write fills out these datastructures and sends a memory address pointing to them to the RCP (translated into a non-virtual, absolute hardware address) so the microcode running on the RCP can read it when needed. It is not copied, only read by the other processor.
That means you need to make sure you have enough of these structures allocated to use for all the unique transforms needed for a particular frame of rendering.
